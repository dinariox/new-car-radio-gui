# New Car Radio GUI

This is a gui for my Raspberry Pi car radio project.
I will use the official Raspberry Pi 7" touchscreen as the display together with a Pi 3A+.

## Planned features

-   Top bar with home button, time display and screen off button
-   Home screen with 4 tiles: bluetooth music, bluetooth calls, fm radio and settings
-   Bluetooth music screen: shows music information and has music controls
-   Bluetooth calls screen: has a dial pad and potentially shows phone contacts
-   FM radio screen: shows frequency, station name, radio text and has controls for switching to a different channel
-   Settings screen: has a few settings like screen brightness and darkmode

## Implementation

I will be using python for the backend stuff. For the frontend, however, I will be using HTML, CSS and JavaScript because that's what I'm most familliar with.
